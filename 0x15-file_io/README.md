TASK IO IN C =========
I/O (input/output) in C programming language refers to the process of reading data from input sources (such as keyboard, file, network, etc.) and writing data to output sources (such as screen, file, network, etc.). The standard library functions used for I/O in C include
printf() and scanf() for formatted input/output.

fprintf() and fscanf() for formatted input/output to/from a file.

getchar() and putchar() for reading and writing a single character.

gets() and puts() for reading and writing strings.

read() and write() for reading and writing raw data.

Note: It's important to use I/O functions correctly in C, as they do not check for buffer overflows and can lead to security vulnerability
