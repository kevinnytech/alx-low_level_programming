Poem...
Variadic, a mystery

In C, a tool of great versatility

With dots and ellipses, it's signature

A function that can take any number



Of arguments, without a care

No need to know in advance to prepare

Just pass them on, with wild abandon

And let the function handle the randomness



But beware, with great power comes great responsibility

Type checking, it's a formality

Forgot to do so, results in insanity

And undefined behavior, a reality



But used correctly, a work of art

A function that can play any part

In any program, it's a key component

Variadic, a true wonderment.
