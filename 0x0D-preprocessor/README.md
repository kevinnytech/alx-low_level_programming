Preprocessor in C is a program that processes your source code before passing it to the compiler for compilation. It is used for various operations like including header files, macro expansions, and conditional compilation. Preprocessor directives begin with a # sign and are followed by a specific keyword. Some of the most commonly used preprocessor directives are #include, #define, #if, and #endif. Preprocessor directives are mainly used to control how a program is compiled.
