A beauty 

Recursion in C, a beauty to see

A function that calls itself, endlessly

A puzzle to solve, a problem to fix

With each call, closer to the mix



A base case to reach, an end to the line

Otherwise, the function will define

An infinite loop, a fatal mistake

A program to crash, for heaven's sake



But used correctly, recursion can thrive

A solution elegant, simple, yet alive

A fractal to draw, a list to reverse

A problem to conquer, with finesse and verve



So let recursion in C be your friend

A tool to use, until the very end

And when you reach that base case at last

You'll find the answer, and make it fast.
