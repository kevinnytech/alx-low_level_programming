Advantages of Linked Lists:
The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of usage, and in practical uses, the upper limit is rarely reached. 
Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because a room has to be created for the new elements and to create a room exiAdvantages of Linked Lists:

 singly linked list so fine and fair

A sequence of nodes linked with care

Each node contains a value, so unique

And a pointer that points ahead, what a tweak!



The first node, the head, leads the way

With its pointer pointing to the next node every day

As we traverse down the list, one by one

We move from node to node, till we reach the last one



The last node has a special trait

Its pointer points to nothing, it’s the end, that's great

This simplicity makes it quite a sight

A linear collection, of nodes, that's just right!



Singly linked lists, a structure so neat

Used in algorithms, for data to treat

Efficiency and speed, it does provide

A must-have tool, for every programmer's side.



So here’s to singly linked lists, a joy to behold

A structure that’s simple, yet, always bold.
